Bricks

![Size Bricks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgar-b/Wackelturm/master/img/parts.jpg)

The first sets are made out of 10 mm poplar plywood. The surface has been sanded and treaded with wood polishing several times. Unfinished Bricks have too much resistance and are hard to pull out of the tower. The surface finish is similar to furniture for children. 

The engraving and the cutting of the bricks should happen in one round, if your cutter has the necessary power, to ensure that the text is centered.

I used an eurolaser m-1200, the following settings may vary depending on your cutter and wood.
The text was realised with:
- 14% power (about 60 Watt)
- 300 dpi resolution
- 700 mm/s speed

The cuts happend with:
- 65% power (about 260 Watt)
- 600 mm/s speed

It may happen that the wood isn't cut all the way through. Cut the remaining thin layer of wood with a sharp knife. 

Due to the nature of lasers, dark discolourations can happen around the cuts. With an barely wet cloth these can be removed. You can also sand down the edges to remove the darkened wood.

Box
---

220 g/mÂ² paper is perfectly fine for the housing, heavier paper is harder to print and fold. The templates are sized DIN A2, available paper is often sized a bit greater, so make sure not to make the template fit on the page but keep it at 100% size.

When cutting manually make sure to cut on the inside of the guidelines. To make the folding easier, carefully scratch toe folding edges on the back side.

Glue the large flap to the side and fill the boy with the bricks.

The inner box doesn't require glue.
